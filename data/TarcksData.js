It is an audio-compressed file used in the modern setting due to increased quality demand as a result of cloud storage and bigger hard drive space in contemporary computers. Its high quality keeps it relevant, as users who need to hear distinct sounds on audio files will need this over more common file types.', '172', 'https://d27jswm5an3efw.cloudfront.net/app/uploads/2019/04/audio-file-types-17.jpg'),
    new Track('t2', 'FLAC ', 'The FLAC audio file is Free Lossless Audio Codec. It is an audio file compressed into a smaller size of the original file. It’s a sophisticated file type that is lesser-used among audio formats. This is because, even though it has its advantages, it often needs special downloads to function. When you consider that audio files are shared often, this can make for quite an inconvenience to each new user who receives one.', '222', 'https://d27jswm5an3efw.cloudfront.net/app/uploads/2019/11/audio-file-types-32.jpg'),

The key feature of MP3 files is the compression that saves valuable space while maintaining near-flawless quality of the original source of sound. This compression makes the MP3 very popular for all mobile audio-playing devices, particularly the Apple iPod.', '35', 'https://d27jswm5an3efw.cloudfront.net/app/uploads/2019/11/audio-file-types-33.jpg'),

The two are completely different and the similarities come from their namesake rather than their functionality. Also note that the MP4 is sometimes referred to as a video file instead of an audio file. This isn’t an error, as in fact it’s both an audio and video file.', '600', 'https://d27jswm5an3efw.cloudfront.net/app/uploads/2019/11/audio-file-types-34.jpg'),

What makes so beneficial is its lossless compression, retaining high audio quality throughout all types of restructuring processes. Even though it’s such a quality audio format, it’s not the most popular due to the fact it’s inaccessible to many users, especially those who don’t use the Windows operating system.', '653', 'https://d27jswm5an3efw.cloudfront.net/app/uploads/2019/11/audio-file-types-36.jpg'),

It has never been one of the most popular audio formats, especially when it comes to music files, but the AAC does still serve some purpose for major systems.
